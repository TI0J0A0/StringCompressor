A simple yet efficient Java project that implements a string compression algorithm.  
If a character is repeated consecutively, it's replaced by the character followed by the count of its occurrences â€” **but only if the result is shorter** than the original string.

---

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Compress strings using the rule:

> Replace repeated characters with that character followed by the number of repetitions â€” but only if the compressed version is shorter than the original.

### âœ… Examples

```java
Input:  "aaabbbcc"
Output: "a3b3c2"

Input:  "abcdef"
Output: "abcdef" // compressed version "a1b1c1d1e1f1" is longer
